# 3329_SyllableGame

The purpose of the project is to develop an interactive and fun game for players to come up with
creative responses while being timed. The game involves players asking questions or making
statements that are then answered by other players. Each response has to have a certain number
of syllables, with the total number of syllables used not exceeding the desired limit.
